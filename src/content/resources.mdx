## Boycott Movement

The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is a Palestinian-led movement promoting boycotts, divestments, and economic sanctions against Israel. Its objective is to pressure Israel to meet what the BDS movement describes as Israel's obligations under international law.

### Key Principles

-   **Boycott** - Withdraw support from Israel's apartheid regime and the companies and institutions that maintain it
-   **Divestment** - Pressure institutions, businesses, and governments to withdraw investments from Israel
-   **Sanctions** - Pressure governments to end military trade, free-trade agreements, and expel Israel from international forums

## Boycott Guidelines

### Consumer Guidelines

1. **Check product origins** - Look for the barcode that starts with 729 (indicating Israel as the country of origin)
2. **Research parent companies** - Many brands are owned by larger companies with ties to Israel
3. **Choose alternatives** - Support local or ethical alternatives to Israeli products
4. **Spread awareness** - Share information about boycotted products with friends and family
